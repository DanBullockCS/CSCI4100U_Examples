# CSCI4100U Examples

These are the in-class example programs from CSCI 4100U.

## Getting Started

Each directory contains a separate project.  To open this project, open the folder in Visual Studio code.  To run this project, use the 'flutter run' command.

## How Will This Work?

After each lecture, the progress for that lecture will be committed and pushed to this repository.  In situations where the demo lasts more than one lecture, the progress between lectures will be updated, and eventually the finished demo will be uploaded.
